# Path Finder

Path Finder is a maze solving program with an easy to use interface which demonstrates Dijkstra's and Prim's algorithm.

## Features

With the path finder app users can draw their own mazes consisting of start and end points and walls which can all be moved around to the users discretion.
Dijkstra's algorithm can then be ran to determine the shortest path from point start to end. To quickly render a tricky puzzle for the computer a maze can be randomly generated using the method of Prim's algorithm in the click of a button. 
There is a road mode which changes the graphics from a simple grid into a cartoony styled town.
